## What Insights Can Be Gained from WAR Trends Across Draft Rounds for Batters and Pitchers?

### Batting Statistics

The first scatter plot below visualizes the **Wins Above Replacement (WAR)** for MLB batting draftees across draft rounds. Each point represents a player, colored based on their batting hand: right-handed, left-handed, or switch-hitter.

#### Key Observations:
1. **WAR Decreases with Later Draft Rounds**: As expected, players drafted in earlier rounds (e.g., rounds 1-10) tend to have higher WAR, while later rounds show diminishing returns.
2. **Switch-Hitters Have Some High WAR Values**: While fewer switch-hitters are drafted, some exhibit significant WAR, indicating that ambidextrous batting can lead to greater utility for teams.
3. **Outliers in Later Rounds**: A few players from rounds 20 and beyond have exceptionally high WAR, demonstrating the occasional success of undervalued players or late bloomers.

### Pitching Statistics

The second scatter plot below examines **Wins Above Replacement (WAR)** for MLB pitching draftees across draft rounds. Each point represents a pitcher, colored based on their throwing hand: right-handed or left-handed.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Consistent Decline in WAR Across Rounds**: Similar to batting, earlier-round pitchers exhibit higher WAR, while later rounds show a steep decline.
2. **Left-Handed Pitchers**: Left-handed pitchers are more sparsely distributed but occasionally achieve high WAR, reflecting the possible demand for left-handed specialists.
3. **Outliers**: A handful of late-round picks exceed expectations with WAR values comparable to early-round selections, underlying the unpredictable nature of pitching talent.

### Why these Interactive Components Are Useful?

#### **Hover for Detailed Player Insights**:
   - Hovering over a data point reveals detailed player information such as name, WAR, draft round, and pick number. This interactivity allows users to explore specific players' data without worrying about cluttering the graph.

#### **Zoom in and out functionality**:
   - The zoom functionality lets users focus on specific draft rounds or WAR ranges, which is especially useful for analyzing dense areas in the scatter plot.

#### **Color Coding**:
   - The use of color to represent batting and pitching hands (e.g., right-handed vs. left-handed players) provides immediate visual differentiation, helping users identify trends related to player attributes.
