# Introduction
Baseball, known as America's favorite pastime, is a sport filled with history, statistics, and tactics. Wins Above Replacement (WAR) is a highly popular metric used to assess a player's total contribution to their team. WAR seeks to assess a player's overall impact on their team by considering their offensive and defensive abilities. In the changing world of baseball, it is essential to comprehend the elements that impact a player's WAR in order to assess talent effectively, in the major leagues as well as during the draft.

The goal of this research is to investigate biases in baseball drafts by examining the factors that impact a player's WAR. We utilize the BaseballR package, a thorough tool for retrieving both past and present baseball information, to discover trends that could impact the selection of players in the MLB draft. We specifically investigate the correlation between WAR outcomes and different factors like player position, age, background (college vs. high school), and historical performance metrics.

Through studying draft biases, our goal is to determine if specific player traits are given too much or too little importance during the drafting process, and if these biases impact a player's future performance in WAR. We analyze a variety of data, such as player stats, draft placement, and career results, to develop a full understanding of what influences a player's worth throughout their career. This approach based on data will offer understanding on how scouting, drafting, and player development could be enhanced to create a more precise and equitable evaluation of player potential
