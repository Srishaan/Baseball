# Conclusion

The exploration revealed notable biases in the MLB draft process, including preferences for high school players, geographic origins, and positional roles. While organizations tend to be cautious when selecting high school players unless they are exceptional, more high school athletes were seen selected in rounds 1 through 5 than in any other part of the draft. This suggests that high school players chosen early are considered elite. Geographic bias is also evident, as draftees are predominantly from major states like California, Texas, and Florida where year-round play is more feasible due to their warmer climate. Positional biases also emerged from the data, showing that players in high-leverage positions, such as left field (LF), center field (CF), and third base (3B), are more likely to succeed based on WAR, as these roles demand strong contributions in both batting and fielding. First base (1B) also stood out, though mainly for its offensive value, as first basemen are typically power hitters who excel in home runs and runs batted in, despite having fewer defensive responsibilities.

However, the exploration faced several limitations. Geographic and institutional biases in scouting could skew the data, and contextual factors like team culture and coaching quality were not accounted for. Additionally, the reliance on WAR as the primary metric, while insightful, does not capture intangible contributions or skills that are not reflected in the metric, such as role adaptability and defensive communication. Time constraints also restrict the analysis, as draft trends and player development strategies evolve over time, which could potentially impact the findings.

Future directions could address these limitations by taking into account of additional performance metrics such as career longevity or specific skill-based statistics. A more in-depth time-series analysis might reveal how draft trends have shifted over decades, factoring in advancements in scouting and development. Furthermore, additional exploration of regional disparities in player development resources and their impact on draft outcomes would provide deeper insights. Analyzing positional specialization in greater depth could also clarify why certain roles yield higher WAR.

Overall, this analysis highlighted several lessons. Draft strategies significantly influence outcomes, with early-round picks offering the highest potential return. It should be noted though that undervalued late-round talent should not be ignored, as seen within the D3 interactive components of WAR trends across draft rounds. While metrics like WAR are useful, they should be contextualized within the broader framework of player roles, team dynamics, and career stages. Biases in talent identification, whether geographic or structural, reveal opportunities for more inclusive and effective scouting strategies. Lastly, the variability in player success highlights the importance of combining quantitative metrics with qualitative assessments to build a more comprehensive understanding of the potential of a baseball draftee.
