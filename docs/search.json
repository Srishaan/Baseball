    "text": "1 Introduction\nBaseball, known as America’s favorite pastime, is a sport filled with history, statistics, and tactics. Wins Above Replacement (WAR) is a highly popular metric used to assess a player’s total contribution to their team. WAR seeks to assess a player’s overall impact on their team by considering their offensive and defensive abilities. In the changing world of baseball, it is essential to comprehend the elements that impact a player’s WAR in order to assess talent effectively, in the major leagues as well as during the draft.\nThe goal of this research is to investigate biases in baseball drafts by examining the factors that impact a player’s WAR. We utilize the BaseballR package, a thorough tool for retrieving both past and present baseball information, to discover trends that could impact the selection of players in the MLB draft. We specifically investigate the correlation between WAR outcomes and different factors like player position, age, background (college vs. high school), and historical performance metrics.\nThrough studying draft biases, our goal is to determine if specific player traits are given too much or too little importance during the drafting process, and if these biases impact a player’s future performance in WAR. We analyze a variety of data, such as player stats, draft placement, and career results, to develop a full understanding of what influences a player’s worth throughout their career. This approach based on data will offer understanding on how scouting, drafting, and player development could be enhanced to create a more precise and equitable evaluation of player potential",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nFor this project, there are four key data sources that will be utilized.\nThe first two datasets are obtained using the pybaseball package, a Python library (last updated on September 8, 2023 with updates every 1-2 months on average) that is provides access to various reputable baseball sources such as FanGraphs and Baseball Reference. By utilizing pybaseball’s implemented batting_stats() and pitching_stats() functions, we get the batting data and pitching statistics for MLB players, saved as “batting_stats.csv” and “pitching_stats.csv”, respectively. The batting statistics dataset has dimensions of 10,665 × 319, and the pitching statistics dataset has the dimensions of 6,423 × 392.\nThe last two datasets are sourced from BaseballR package, an R library (last updated on January 16, 2024 with updates every 2-3 months on average) designed for accessing and analyzing baseball data from other reputable sources such as Statcast (an analytics system used by the MLB to track baseball data) and Baseball Savant. Using the BaseballR package, we retrieve baseball draft data for each year from 1965 to 2023, which includes details about player drafts such as team, round, and selection year, saved as “draft_df.csv”. Additionally, we run the chadwick_player_lu() function from BaseballR to get a database of player biographical and career information from the Chadwick Baseball Bureau, which we save as “chadwick_data.csv”. The draft dataset has dimensions of 67903 x 84 and the Chadwick player dataset has dimensions of 512843 x 40.\nA description of the issues/problems with the data will be provided in the missing value analysis section below.",

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\nWithin our data, we see a plethora of missing values from each of our data sets.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(baseballr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\nWithin our batting statistics dataset, there are a large amount of missing values, where even some variables have the same amount of missing values as there are rows in the dataset. For variables that have this situation, it is due to that feature not being applicable for batters. For example, a variable tracking a specific pitch type (like UN% or FT%) will not have data since the data primarily focuses on batting. There are some variables that contain some missing variables, which may be due to data collection gaps or data source limitation. Other common statistics though, such as AB (At Bats), H (Hits), and RBI (Runs Batted In), are core metrics in baseball datasets and are therefore recorded in our dataset without missing values. Due to the large nature of this dataset where there are over 319 variables, a summary of missing values is included instead of a heatmap visually showing the missing values of each variable at each column. A count of how many columns contain missing values and how many do not is also shown for greater clarification on the significant amount of missing variables.\n\n\nCode\nbatting_stats &lt;- read_csv(\"batting_stats.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\nbatting_na_count = colSums(is.na(batting_stats)) |&gt;\n  sort(decreasing = TRUE)\nhead(batting_na_count, 10)\n\n\n  FT% (sc)   UN% (sc)   vFT (sc)  FT-X (sc)  FT-Z (sc)   wFT (sc) wFT/C (sc) \n     10665      10665      10665      10665      10665      10665      10665 \n       xBA       xSLG      xwOBA \n     10665      10665      10665 \n\n\nCode\ntail(batting_na_count, 10)\n\n\n    WAR     Spd     BsR     Def     wSB Age Rng     Off      Lg  Events   L-WAR \n      0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0 \n\n\nCode\ncolumns_with_na_batting &lt;- sum(colSums(is.na(batting_stats)) &gt; 0)\ncolumns_without_na_batting &lt;- sum(colSums(is.na(batting_stats)) == 0)\ncat(\"Batting Columns with NA values:\", columns_with_na_batting, \"\\n\")\n\n\nBatting Columns with NA values: 270 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Batting Columns without NA values:\", columns_without_na_batting, \"\\n\")\n\n\nBatting Columns without NA values: 49 \n\n\nWithin our pitching statistics dataset, there are also a large amount of missing values, though there are not as many variables nor observations as that of the batting dataset. Again, some variables contain have the same amount of missing values as there are rows in the dataset. For variables that have this situation, it is due to that feature not being applicable for pitchers. For example, a variable tracking advanced metrics such as Stf+ FO (Stuff+ for Four-Seam Fastballs) or Loc+ FO (Location+ for Four-Seam Fastballs) will not have data since these variables require specific conditions or a sufficient sample size of pitches to calculate, making them inapplicable to all pitchers. There are some variables that contain some missing values, which may be due to data collection gaps or data source limitations. Other common statistics, such as W (Wins), L (Losses), and ERA (Earned Run Average), are core metrics in baseball datasets and are therefore recorded in our dataset without missing values. Due to the large nature of this dataset where there are over 392 variables, a summary of missing values is included instead of a heatmap visually showing the missing values of each variable at each column. A count of how many columns contain missing values and how many do not is also shown for greater clarification on the significant amount of missing variables.\n\n\nCode\npitching_stats &lt;- read_csv(\"pitching_stats.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\nWarning: One or more parsing issues, call `problems()` on your data frame for details,\ne.g.:\n  dat &lt;- vroom(...)\n  problems(dat)\n\n\nCode\npitching_na_count = colSums(is.na(pitching_stats)) |&gt;\n  sort(decreasing = TRUE)\nhead(pitching_na_count, 10)\n\n\n FT% (sc)  FO% (sc)  UN% (sc)  vFT (sc)  vFO (sc) FT-X (sc) FO-X (sc) FT-Z (sc) \n     6423      6423      6423      6423      6423      6423      6423      6423 \nFO-Z (sc)  wFT (sc) \n     6423      6423 \n\n\nCode\ntail(pitching_na_count, 10)\n\n\n      K%      BB%      E-F  RA9-WAR BIP-Wins LOB-Wins FDP-Wins  Age Rng \n       0        0        0        0        0        0        0        0 \n   K-BB%   Events \n       0        0 \n\n\nCode\ncolumns_with_na_pitching &lt;- sum(colSums(is.na(pitching_stats)) &gt; 0)\ncolumns_without_na_pitching &lt;- sum(colSums(is.na(pitching_stats)) == 0)\ncat(\"Pitching Columns with NA values:\", columns_with_na_pitching, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPitching Columns with NA values: 344 \n\n\nCode\ncat(\"Pitching Columns without NA values:\", columns_without_na_pitching, \"\\n\")\n\n\nPitching Columns without NA values: 48 \n\n\nMissing values are also present within the Chadwick data, which contains the biographical and career information of people associated with the MLB. Some columns are seen to be entirely misisng given that they are shown as solid red bars, which suggests that these variables are either not relevant to the dataset’s context or represent data that was not collected. Other columns have a mix of missing and non-missing values, which means that these variables may suffer from data collection gaps or were conditionally applicable, such as metrics that may applicable to baseball managers or metrics that were unavailable for certain time periods. Lastly, columns with no missing values as seen with white bars represent essential metrics such as a person’s name and position in the MLB. These metrics are recorded across the Chadwick dataset which shows that despite it having missing data present, its key metrics still are reliably available for analysis.\n\n\nCode\nchadwick_data &lt;- read_csv(\"chadwick_data.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\nchadwick_data_uniform &lt;- chadwick_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(everything(), as.character))\n\nmissing_chadwick &lt;- chadwick_data_uniform %&gt;%\n  mutate(row_id = row_number()) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(-row_id, names_to = \"variable\", values_to = \"value\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(missing = is.na(value))\n\nggplot(missing_chadwick, aes(x = variable, y = row_id, fill = missing)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"FALSE\" = \"white\", \"TRUE\" = \"red\"), name = \"Missing\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Heatmap of Missing Values in Chadwick Data\",\n    x = \"Variables\",\n    y = \"Rows\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    axis.text.y = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, missing values were also present within the draft data containing the team, round, and selection year of a player. To visualize the missing values in this dataset, I selected the top 20 variables with the most missing values and the top 20 with the least missing values. This was done due to there being a large amount of variables present in the dataset, though it was not as extensive as those in the batting and pitching datasets. Some columns are seen to be entirely misisng given that they are shown as solid red bars, which suggests that they might not be applicable to the dataset’s context, such as fields related to specific player demographics or draft-related outcomes that were not recorded. Other columns have a mix of missing and non-missing values, which means that these variables may suffer from data collection gaps or were attributes relevant only to certain players, teams, or draft rounds. Lastly, columns with no missing values as seen with white bars represent essential metrics such as a player’s name, their draft pick numbers, or other key metrics that are consistently recorded. These metrics are recorded throughout the draft dataset, which still demonstrates that while missing data is also present in this dataset, the key metrics in this dataset also still remain reliably available for analysis.\n\n\nCode\ndraft_data &lt;- read_csv(\"draft_data.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\ntop_missing_vars_draft &lt;- draft_data |&gt;\n  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.)))) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = \"variable\", values_to = \"missing_count\") |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(missing_count)) |&gt;\n  slice(1:20) |&gt;\n  pull(variable)\n\nleast_missing_vars_draft&lt;- draft_data |&gt;\n  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.)))) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = \"variable\", values_to = \"missing_count\") |&gt;\n  arrange(missing_count) |&gt;\n  slice(1:20) |&gt;\n  pull(variable)\n\ndraft_subset &lt;- draft_data |&gt;\n  select(all_of(c(top_missing_vars_draft, least_missing_vars_draft)))\n\ndraft_data_uniform &lt;- draft_subset |&gt;\n  mutate(across(everything(), as.character))\n\nmissing_draft &lt;- draft_data_uniform |&gt;\n  mutate(row_id = row_number()) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(-row_id, names_to = \"variable\", values_to = \"value\") |&gt;\n  mutate(missing = is.na(value))\n\nggplot(missing_draft, aes(x = variable, y = row_id, fill = missing)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"FALSE\" = \"white\", \"TRUE\" = \"red\"), name = \"Missing\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Heatmap of Missing Values in Draft Data\",\n    x = \"Variables\",\n    y = \"Rows\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    axis.text.y = element_blank()\n  )",
