    "text": "1 Introduction\nBaseball, known as America’s favorite pastime, is a sport filled with history, statistics, and tactics. Wins Above Replacement (WAR) is a highly popular metric used to assess a player’s total contribution to their team. WAR seeks to assess a player’s overall impact on their team by considering their offensive and defensive abilities. In the changing world of baseball, it is essential to comprehend the elements that impact a player’s WAR in order to assess talent effectively, in the major leagues as well as during the draft.\nThe goal of this research is to investigate biases in baseball drafts by examining the factors that impact a player’s WAR. We utilize the BaseballR package, a thorough tool for retrieving both past and present baseball information, to discover trends that could impact the selection of players in the MLB draft. We specifically investigate the correlation between WAR outcomes and different factors like player position, age, background (college vs. high school), and historical performance metrics.\nThrough studying draft biases, our goal is to determine if specific player traits are given too much or too little importance during the drafting process, and if these biases impact a player’s future performance in WAR. We analyze a variety of data, such as player stats, draft placement, and career results, to develop a full understanding of what influences a player’s worth throughout their career. This approach based on data will offer understanding on how scouting, drafting, and player development could be enhanced to create a more precise and equitable evaluation of player potential",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nFor this project, there are four key data sources that will be utilized.\nThe first two datasets are obtained using the pybaseball package, a Python library (last updated on September 8, 2023 with updates every 1-2 months on average) that is provides access to various reputable baseball sources such as FanGraphs and Baseball Reference. By utilizing pybaseball’s implemented batting_stats() and pitching_stats() functions, we get the batting data and pitching statistics for MLB players, saved as “batting_stats.csv” and “pitching_stats.csv”, respectively. The batting statistics dataset has dimensions of 10,665 × 319, and the pitching statistics dataset has the dimensions of 6,423 × 392.\nThe last two datasets are sourced from BaseballR package, an R library (last updated on January 16, 2024 with updates every 2-3 months on average) designed for accessing and analyzing baseball data from other reputable sources such as Statcast (an analytics system used by the MLB to track baseball data) and Baseball Savant. Using the BaseballR package, we retrieve baseball draft data for each year from 1965 to 2023, which includes details about player drafts such as team, round, and selection year, saved as “draft_df.csv”. Additionally, we run the chadwick_player_lu() function from BaseballR to get a database of player biographical and career information from the Chadwick Baseball Bureau, which we save as “chadwick_data.csv”. The draft dataset has dimensions of 67903 x 84 and the Chadwick player dataset has dimensions of 512843 x 40.\nA description of the issues/problems with the data will be provided in the missing value analysis section below.",
